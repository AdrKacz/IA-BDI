# IA-BDI, Multi Agent Spaceship


This is a 2D-simulation of multiple spaceships travelling through empty space to gather resources.

Spaceships are only aware of what is in front of them and can release markers that diffuse in space.

Resources are gather by lot in space.

## How to run the simulation

Go to [itch - Spaceship Simulation](https://adrkacz.itch.io/spaceship-simulation), and click **Run project**.

*There is a space under the project to let you write any suggestion you can have.*

### I want to edit and run the project

1. Go to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) official website and download the engine you need.

2. Clone this Git Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AdrKacz/IA-BDI.git
```

3. Open **Godot**, and *scan* the folder you've just imported. The project *Spaceship-Simulation* should appear. Double-click on it to open it. Once done, click on the *Play* icon at the top right of your screen to launch it.

4. To learn more about Godot, go to their superb [documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).

## The problem

Our home is lost in space and needs to retrieve **resources** around to survive.

You can release **spaceships** to go look for near by resources.

However, spaceships don't have an efficient radar, and pilots only see what is **not too far and in front** of them.

To help them in their quest, pilots can release **two types of markers** in space while flying. These markers evaporate and **lose visibility over time**.

Once they leaved their home, pilots have **no idea where they are**, and how to find back their home.

**Space is great and dark.**

*Good luck!*
